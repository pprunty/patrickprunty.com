Artificial Intelligence (A.I) based voice synthesis is getting good, _really good_.

You've probably encountered just how good it is during one of your penitant doom-scrolling
sessions (don't worry I do it too).

ElevenLabs is leading the offerings in this service. Lex Fridman notably used this technology
to dub his podcast with Ukraine Prime Minister, Wladimir Zelensky.

So why am I doing it? Do I want to illegally clone a celebrity's voice? Noooooo.

This year, I have a[ desire to get into the content creation space](/blog/2024-in-review). However,
I have found some trouble writing scripts, only to have to re-write them again, and again, and _again_ because they don't sound
quite right in post-production.

That's where ElevenLabs comes in. Instead of having to setup my audio equipment and complete
multiple takes of my script, I can use my voice clone to get a feel for how things will sound using my syntheticly generated voice.

# Instant Voice Cloning [#instant-voice-cloning]

The basic service offered by ElevenLabs is instant voice cloning.

This service allows you to clone your voice using a
transcript and a recording of your voice. The service is available to use in the basic $1 subscription, but you must pay
for a professional voice clone (more on that later).

To get the best results, ElevenLabs recommends you use a production grade microphone and pop-filter <Ref id="1" />. I use a SHURE MV7, the second best SHURE microphone, with a
SHURE \_\_ pop-filter (because some guy on YouTube said it sounds as good as the more expensive model with the
more expensive model's pop-filter).

It is important to use a transcript that capture the nuances of your voice by enunciating the different sounds in the
language you speak. You can download the sentences I used [here](/downloads/elevenlabs_sentences.txt) <Ref id="2" />.

Transcript used:

```txt
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

My authentic voice:

<MP3 src="/downloads/pprunty2.mp3" />

ElevenLabs voice clone:

<MP3 src="/downloads/elevenlabs2.mp3" />

```txt
- “In the bustling city, people hurriedly pass by, lost in their own worlds."
- "The serene sunset painted the sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple."
- "Sizzling bacon and freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen with enticing aromas."
- "Gentle waves lapped against the shore, creating a soothing symphony of nature."
- "A mysterious figure emerged from the shadows, casting a long silhouette on the dimly lit alley."
- "In the heart of the forest, the rustling leaves whispered secrets of ancient times."
- "With a burst of laughter, friends gathered around a crackling bonfire under the starlit night sky."
```

Can you tell the difference?

I must admit I recognize a similarity with my own authentic voice, even with the americanized accent.
This is even more impressive considering it used only ~3 minutes of recorded audio to generate a clone.
