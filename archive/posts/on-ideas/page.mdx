Creative output has been hard to come by recently. 

I mean, I have plenty of ideas. But it's executing them which is the problem.

One of these ideas was to start reading more. And unlike many of my other bright ideas, 
I followed through on this one. 

Reading again feels like I'm playing Tetris. But instead of the blocks falling faster after 
completing a level, they fall slower. Giving me more time to piece everything together.
