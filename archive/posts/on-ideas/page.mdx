Creative output has been hard to come by recently.

I mean, I have plenty of ideas. But it's executing them which is the problem.

One of these ideas was to start reading more. And unlike many of my other bright ideas,
I followed through on this one.

Reading again feels like playing Tetris. But instead of the blocks falling faster after each level, they fall slower. Giving me time to piece the different parts of my life together.
