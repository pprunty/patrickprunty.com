_This post is a quick reflection of my achievements, goals and lessons learned this year._

# I'm Senior Now [#getting-old]

In September this year I was promoted as part of a transition to a new team to the role
of senior full-stack web developer. Meaning **more money**, **more responsibility**, and **more hours**.

While shifting from AI/ML back to web development might seem counterintuitive in today's tech landscape,
I'm now part of a product focused team that puts the **user** first.

Diamonds don't shine when they're buried deep in the ground.
If you want the attention of leadership within your company, you need to put a bow and tie on the innovations you create. Web
and product development allows exactly for that.

# You're Just a Number [#just-a-number]

Work is important, you need to continuously perform and go
beyond expectations to maintain a NET
positive value in the eye of the beholder (your employer), however, there is more to life.

For my colleagues and loved ones who were affected by layoffs in tech this year, it was a realization to
me that this is unfortunately but another part of the tech industry and that at the end of the day, it's just a job.

# Good Morning Vietnam [#good-morning-vietnam]

This year my girlfriend and I visited Vietnam—from Hanoi’s bustling streets to Sapa’s misty peaks and Hồ Chí Minh City’s humid energy.

An 11-hour trip, ending in 30 degree celsius dampening heat, then a taxi ride resembling that of the night
bus from Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azakaban and I was re-thinking what we got ourselves into.

Driving in Vietnam is like skiing, you
watch out for the people in front of you and let them know you're coming by beeping the horn (you shout left or right skiing)
and you don't worry about the people behind you because they'll let you know that they're coming. There is structure to the chaos.

Cross the roads with your eyes closed or behind a crooked old man or lady.

I'm really not sure if the European way of driving is more or less evolved, there seems to be a method to the madness
in this style of driving in Vietnam.

hiking with sapa sisters was one of the highlights of my year.

This trip opened my eyes to the fact that regardless of culture, race or creed.
Under the surface, all people are the same, more or less.

# Trying a Tri [#try-a-tri]

This year, I celebrated my birthday by completing my first mini triathlon: [RDJ's Try-a-Tri](https://www.dublincitytriathlon.com/).

Though the distances were modest compared to my past running/cycling events, having
nearly drowned as a child, and developed a fear of open water, it was a big deal to me.

Placing second has fueled my ambition to tackle a Sprint/Olympic triathlon in 2025, with eyes set on an IRONMAN 70.3.

# Predicting The Future [#predicting-the-future]

![Scene From 2001: A Space Odyssey](/images/space-odyssey.webp)

Streaming will get bigger (Twitch). Personifying 'chat' during livestreams.

NVIDIA will continue to grow. If you needed any evidence, Lex Fridman's podcast with Dario \_\_ should convince you, where
he consistently references the [scaling hypothesis]()

Now is a pretty good time to have dollars.

Migration statistics in Ireland will break another all-time high, in line with last year's statistics

old people will continue to get old and young people will continue to delay having children.

# New Year's Resolution [#new-years-resolution]

_Create, create, create._

You spend your 20s figuring it out, your 30s doing it, and your 40s enjoying it.

I think I've figured it out.

This year, I want to channel my creativity. To express who I am, and help others through what I create.
