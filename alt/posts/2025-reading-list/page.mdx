# Reviews [#reviews]

## *Small Things Like These* by Claire Keegan [#small-things-like-these]

Heartwarming novella, reminiscent of *Foster*. Keegan uses simple, yet sophisticated language combined with the Irish
vernacular to convey how doing of the smallest of things can make the biggest impact on the lives of others.

## *A Dance with Dragons* by George R.R Martin [#a-dance-with-dragons]

The fifth book in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series. Martin continues to create an atmosphere of tension as things come
to a head in Westeros. Tyrion's chapters in particular are a highlight, as he navigates the political landscape of Essos
and experiences firsthand the experience of being a slave.

It is worth noting, Martin intended for there to be a five-year gap between *A Storm of Swords* and both
*A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons*, however, disagreements with editors and the complexity of the story led to
the gap being abandoned.

There is, however, much to look forward to in the upcoming *The Winds of Winter*. Including the fate of Jon Snow, the
battle at Winterfell, and the mystery of the [Pink Letter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-j01uhSdGo). That is, if George R.R Martin ever actually finishes the book...

In the meantime, I compiled all the preview chapters of *The Winds of Winter* into a PDF, eBook and Kindle formats. You
can download them [here](/blog/the-winds-of-winter-preview-chapters-free-ebook-kindle-and-pdf-download).
