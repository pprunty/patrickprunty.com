**MAKE ME FEEL** ... How does one feel? Through the senses. Sight, sound, smell, touch and taste. Sunsets, laughter, perfume, hugs and chocolate.

If your writing does not make me feel, it is as good as a corpse. Rotting. Emitting dead odors. As the grass beneath beseech it and the maggots infest the top.

It should shrill and shriek. Read like beautiful music. A birdsong sung high in the morning trees, passed down through generation.

Machines may imitate. Their imitations are our imitations; all of our data collected. Processed and pre-processed to an artificial ideal. A flower without a bee. A heart that does not beat. They cannot _feel_.

They do not understand the story within the story, they cannot relate. Only imitate, **never** create.

To avoid the mirror's gaze, writing must fundamentally change.

---

- Do not use overly complex language. If your friends would not understand it, then how would the world?
- You should be able to tell your story aloud. A good practice is to start from this notion and work backwards. Tell your story, then embellish it in your writing.
- If any of your writing, be it a paragraph, sentence or single word, does not contribute in some percentage to the telling of the story, remove it.

If your writing does not make me feel. Bin it. Burn it. Break it.
