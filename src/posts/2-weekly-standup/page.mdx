It's amazing how things appear smaller with time.

That three hour plane journey which felt like the most ass numbing journey ever? Easy. That hill up to the apartment that would steal your breathe away? Race you to the top. The bustling village you grew up in where nobody knew your name? 

Anyway, here's some links.

* An interesting article on how ["everyone knows your location"](https://timsh.org/tracking-myself-down-through-in-app-ads/) You might think something like "*Well,* I'm not important enough to care if they know where I am or not" and if so, you're correct. They don't care. As little as one cares about the whereabouts of a fly when it escapes out the window. But knowing where _all_ of the flies go when it gets dark, where they congregate, how they communicate. That on the contrary, would reveal insights that could manifest in a kind of value, _if_ only one had an easy way of collecting the data...
* I didn't know motion could be captured in such a way through cameras. One particular shot really captured my attention. Where the [movement of footsteps were recorded could be traced](https://youtu.be/NSS6yAMZF78?si=6a4wcUODs_UJNQnw&t=167). For an organism to have this kind of vision would be akin to a superpower. But alas, I realised this was only possible when the camera was set in a stable location for some time. But there's still a use case for  hunting and tracking activities, or on a more sour note, warfare.

* I've been exploring [Delta Components](https://deltacomponents.dev), a beautifully crafted component library for building interfaces that react to user input. The visual design system is especially elegant, and the components are highly customizable. Check it out below:
