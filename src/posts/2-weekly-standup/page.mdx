> *"There's this great tall tree in the jungle,"* he started. *"And on that tree, there are monkeys on every branch. The leaders of this group sit on the branches at the top of the tree. And when the leaders look down, all they see are happy, smiling monkeys looking up at them. But for the monkeys at the bottom of the tree, when they look up, all they see is arseholes."*


Anyway, here’s some links.

* You might think something like “*Well,* I’m not important enough to care if they know where I am or not” and if so, you’re correct. They don’t care. As little as one cares about the whereabouts of a fly when it escapes out the window. But knowing where _all_ of the flies go when it gets dark, where they congregate, how they communicate. That on the contrary, would reveal insights that could manifest in a kind of value, _if_ only one had an easy way of collecting the data... 
* I didn’t know motion could be captured in such a way through cameras. One particular shot really captured my attention. Where the [movement of footsteps were recorded could be traced](https://youtu.be/NSS6yAMZF78?si=6a4wcUODs_UJNQnw&t=167). For an organism to have this kind of vision would be akin to a superpower. But alas, I realised this was only possible when the camera was set in a stable location for some time. But there’s still a use case for  hunting and tracking activities, or on a more sour note, warfare.

* An old classic I vibed with this week:
    <Spotify trackId="0qxYx4F3vm1AOnfux6dDxP" />
* And a more funky beat that takes you somewhere well, *funky*:
    <Spotify trackId="2zQl59dZMzwhrmeSBEgiXY" />
* Nostalgia. Just missing its [sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nQ2oiVqKHw).
