You have this amazing fortune of being you. Some people 
might share similar physical characteristics, sound the same, or share the same mannerisms. 
But they're not you. You're unique. This doesn't, however, stop people from moving away from 
who they really are, and towards an image of what they _want_ to be. 

This is deep. But ask yourself: If I were to die tomorrow, would what my friends and family read on my blog bring them closer to me? Do blog post like, 
_"Top 5 Christmas Dinner Recipes Using an Airfryer"_, _"I Built a HashMap from Scratch in C++"_ or 
another CTR<Ref id="1"/>, SEO<Ref id="2"/>-optimized bore-post showcase what makes you uniquely you?

Many seek to emulate Casey Neistat, the famous YouTube vlogger's style of video making. He made a video 
... in it<Ref id="3"/>, he literally gives you the recipe: 

> _"Blah blah blah"_

Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery and monkey see, monkey do. Humanity would not be where it is today if it wasn't for our unique ability to emulate other's innovative actions 
both physically and mentally. But if we all stopped having original thought and imitated only what others do to the minutiae, we would resemble 
a sims game. Don't get me wrong, it's OK to take, or steal from another. But if you do, you need to make it yours. Or _"put a spin on it"_ as they say.

Casey does one thing that I've stolen. He's scrappy. Being scrappy is a fantastic way of chanelling _you_. By saying
"yes" more  because it feels good, and "no" less because it doesn't conform to industry or your role models' standards.
We've all been in that place where we look at our work in dismay, because when compared against another's it's not good enough. And so, we try harder 
to perfect the imitation. Only to flounder at the end, _usually_ because what's been created has become alien to you.

Remember that movie you start watching _en medias res_ and enjoyed so much? Would you enjoy it more 
or less had it been recommended by a famous celebrity on Twitter, or because in that moment, you forgot about everything else, 
and watched it on a whim?


Paul Grahams'<Ref id="3"/> post on [_Writes and Write Nots_]() struck me. In it, he details how we're on a one-way collision course unto a world
wherein nobody writes anymore. This is due to the advance in A.I and specifically, LLMs. So when I talk about writing, I mean _writing_. Not the 
prompt, copy and paste writing you see shaping the new Internet. That's why reading this feels different. Because 
you know these words started as but a seed in the far corners of my mind, found their way to the forefront of my thoughts, were 
scribbled on the corner of a page somewhere, and then digitalized as pixels on this screen infront of you for you to read. 

I put my feelings into what 
I write, so that in discovering more about myself, I can encourage you to do the same. And my mind and yours can connect like in handshake through this text.

Only the other day, my manager told me this business term: "Blue Ocean, Red Ocean"

For instance, imagine you had to make a presentation tomorrow, 

stick figures / being scrappy as a good way of chaneling "you" and saying yes more because you like it, and "no" less because it 
doesn't conform to industry or your role models' standards.

Not much is your anymore, it's taken, or stolen from another.
