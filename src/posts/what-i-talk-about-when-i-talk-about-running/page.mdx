As long as destiny allows, I will continue running.

I don't hop out of bed in the morning and say, "I can't wait to get out and run 16km today." In fact, I don't enjoy a
large percentage of the runs that I do. But I know and understand that it's part of the process. And through repetition,
I've seen the direct result of enduring a process over time.

I know it's part of what I have to do.

There's no other option.

If I want to grow, if I want to get better, if I want to accomplish a certain thing, I have to do it. I have to do that thing.
I have to get out and run.

There's no other option.
