An **Indie Hacker** is somebody who independently builds, advertises, and launches applications in public. A **liar**, on the other hand, is someone who deliberately misrepresents facts or circumstances to deceive others, gain support, and achieve personal or financial gain.

I’m not saying that *every* Indie Hacker is a liar. But I’ve got a hunch that some of them are lying.

People go where people go. 

In a world where there exists a multitude of solutions for your every need, be it in the form of a gadget or website, all of which offering slight variations on its theme, the age old mantra, “build it and they’ll come” is dead in the water. They don’t know where to go.

Nowadays, the saying reads more like, “build it, market it well (and by that, I mean better than your competitors), then they’ll come”

Good marketing is measured simply by conversion rates. This leads to people evolving slightly unethical practices to increase that variable. The person with the most clicks, wins.

For instance, I could falsify the view count for my blog posts such that readers would associate a higher credibility with the content before even reading it. But that would be a lie. And my conscious does not allow for such practices. 

But suppose I pay somebody to build and market my website and tell them, “If you can get me more traffic, I’ll pay you double” And they use such practices to increase the conversion rate, is my conscious clear? What about if I rely on my website and writing as a main source of income, would *I* myself be forced to consider implementing such practices? After all, somebody has to put food on the table. Would such a lie hurt so bad?
