> *Hello world*

I don't even like golf. Parlty because it's so slow, mostly because I'm terrible at it. I just don't have the patience. But this year I was
**glued** to the screen watching the events unfold.

    - *Aside*: The subtitle of this article is called, *"or: The Emperor Has No Clothes"*
- Introducing [**magikarp**](https://github.com/pprunty/magikarp), an open source plugin-based agentic LLM framework built with Go (inspired by the above article).
    - *Aside*: The name choice 'magikarp' comes from an assignment I was given as part of an interview process with [Nothing (company)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_(company)).
      They were looking for ways to integrate A.I onto their mobile devices and tasked me with developing a system which provided friendly, data contextually aware notifications to the end user, like *"Hey, I see you're listening to a lot of Bon Jovi lately, maybe give ACDC a try?"*.
      I spent a couple of days brainstorming, then created a Python-based solution with Llama3.1 and Ollama integration. This was before "tools" was a thing so it was a lot of prompt engineering and response cleansing. Anyways, they blanked me.

Are all small size companies/startups like this? Considering the breathe of fresh air having been given a real company problem to solve versus your
typical virtual coding and system design assessment, I hope not.

- [Crossing the uncanny valley of conversational voice](https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice#demo) - I'm interested in
figuring out where this technology is going. When you speak with another person, the way we say things encode additional meaning. For example, there's an enormous difference in saying *"ehm, I don't know"* in a passive tone versus
saying, *"I have no idea actually"* with a rising intonation. The former indicates I don't really care to know more, don't tell me. The later invites continuation. These undertones are typically expressed
automatically by humans and accompanied with body language. I assume it would be difficult to train a conversational AI to understand these undertones, considering
we don't know about many of them ourselves but then again, I wouldn't be surprised.
