The word *<b>iteration</b>* lives in my mind rent-free.

I mean, I don't remember the last time I looked at a piece of completed work, took two steps back, tilted my head and whispered 
to myself, *"it's perfect"*. 

In the world of engineering, *it's never perfect*. It can **always be better**.

{/*
In the software engineering world—my world—it can **run faster**, **look better** and/or **scale better**.
*/}

Like other engineers who share this proclivity, I compare my work against the highest standards.

I create a ceiling for myself; with which I, so consumed in the pursuit of perfection,
would never realise I have reached, even had I vaulted over it.

Were I the one who painted The Mona Lisa, I'd probably break into The Louvre most nights to
give it touch-ups...

But it's OK.

I have come to terms with this <del>sickness</del> proclivity.

In realising that perfection is something you engage *with*, like in a dance, and not something you *attain*,
like a medal or plaque.


...

And so I take comfort in knowing that it'll never be perfect—let alone done.

I'd much rather be like that of a drip painter. Who instead of having to speak the language of *if*, *then*, *else*, *and*,
*or*, *but*, *do* and *do nots* in order to give life to autonomous agent,

could let my mind go blank and my hand go where it wanted.
Not deliberate, not random, someplace inbetween.

The pursuit for perfection may seem a trivial pursuit. But in order for your work
to stay relevant, or become a standard with which others can measure themselves against, it requires evolution.
It requires constant iteration.

(2) What I would prefer to be like / ex machina scene

(3) Realizing it'll never be perfect


(ex machina scene)

In order for engineers to give life to autonomous agents, be it through software, a bridge or building,
they must first live in and speak the language of *if*, *then*, *else*, *and*, *or*, *but*,
*do* and *do nots*.

The engineer's proclivity for perfection may seem a trivial pursuit. But in order for your work
to stay relevant, it requires evolution. Constant iteration.
