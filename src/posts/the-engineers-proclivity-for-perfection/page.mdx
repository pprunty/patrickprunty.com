The word *<b>iteration</b>* lives in my mind rent-free.

I mean, I don't remember the last time I looked at a piece of completed work, took two steps back, tilted my head, and exclaimed out loud, *"It's perfect"*.

In the world of engineering, *it's never perfect*. It can **always be better**.

In the software engineering world—my world—it can **run faster**, **look better** and/or **scale better**.

Like other engineers who share this proclivity <Ref id="1"/>, I compare my work against the highest of standards.

I create a ceiling for myself; with which so consumed in the pursuit of perfection,
would never realise I have reached, even had I vaulted over it.

It pains me to admit, but were I the one who painted The Mona Lisa, I'd probably break into The Louvre most nights to
give it touch-ups...

But it's OK.

I have come to terms with this <del>obsession</del> proclivity.

In realising that (in the world of engineeering) perfection is something you engage *with*, like in a dance, and not something you can *attain*,
like a medal or plaque.

Instead of pursuing perfection, as if it were a place one could arrive, engineers should pursue the act of pursuing perfection, which is a much
simpler place to arrive.

This mindset is difficult. For if it's
not others moving the goalposts, it's you moving them for yourself. And every time you lean back in your chair,
dust your hands off, and exhale a sigh of relief, it's bittersweet because you know the next iteration is just around the corner.

But if you approach the next iteration as if it were but another dance, you will take comfort in knowing that it'll never be perfect—let alone *done*.
