In Ireland, [Revolut](), the banking app has gained enormous popularity, underpinning national banks such as Bank of Ireland, AIB, ....
Their sucess in Ireland is attributed to a number of things. Namely:

1. The ease of transferring money to a friend.
2. The ability (in the early) days to exchange currency at a free rate.
3. The design of their application.


Revolut has been doing business in Ireland for ___ years and the other banks have not caught up. 

Reverse engineering the problem, let's imagine how the Revolut founders designed 
their application. The CEO, ___, is on record as saying he wanted to create Revolut to make exhanging 
money free but they have compeititon so how do they compete?
