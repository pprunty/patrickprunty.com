*This is Part 2/3 in my series on developing a scalable SaaS product with Next.js for commercial use.*

In a previous blog post, I wrote on [Pure Web Design](/blog/pure-web-design) and how by abstracting the **layout** and **composition** layers of a website,
developers may focus on the innermost **widget** layer. The widget layer consists of creating the components which drive the core-value offerings of a product.

These widgets could be for example, a **login form**, a **shopping cart**, or a **video player**.

The widget(s) with which a developer creates is based on the *workflows* of the product they are developing. Moreover,
a widget should enable the desire of the user to complete a task or a series of tasks in the product.

In this blog post, I will discuss how to map user workflows to widgets and how to view the product development process
through the lens of workflow-driven design.

# Workflow-Driven Design [#workflow-driven-design]


In Ireland, [Revolut](), the banking app has gained enormous popularity, underpinning national banks such as Bank of Ireland, AIB, ....
Their sucess in Ireland is attributed to a number of things. Namely:

1. The ease of transferring money to a friend.
2. The ability (in the early) days to exchange currency at a free rate.
3. The design of their application.


Revolut has been doing business in Ireland for ___ years and the other banks have not caught up. 

Reverse engineering the problem, let's imagine how the Revolut founders designed 
their application. The CEO, ___, is on record as saying he wanted to create Revolut to make exhanging 
money free but they have compeititon so how do they compete?
