When I was a boy, all I wanted to do was to play football, draw and write stories. I cared little 
for applying myself to the sort of the educational discipline required of Irish boys at the time.

It is a strange surprise then, that I would go on to study computer programming. Even stranger so, it would be in a time
where computer programmers would develop applications to emulate creative outputs such as those I loved to do as a boy.


In my recent travels, I've spoken to people in fields as journalism, architecture and interior design who harbour a
considerable angst at the rapid advance in AI.
