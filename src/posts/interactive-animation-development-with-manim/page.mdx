[Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) is an open-source Python library designed for creating mathematical animations. Originally developed by [Grant Sanderson](https://twitter.com/3blue1brown) for his YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown), Manim is ideal for producing visually stunning mathematical visualizations. However, its flexibility makes it a powerful general-purpose animation engine for those with experience in software development.


By the end of this guide, you'll be able to:

1. **Create animations like this**:
    <MP4
      src="/videos/sample-video.mp4"
      controls
      autoplay
      loop
      muted
      className="rounded-md shadow-lg"
    />
2. **Use an interactive animation development environment like this**:
    <MP4
      src="/videos/sample-video.mp4"
        controls
        autoplay
        loop
        muted
      className="rounded-md shadow-lg"
    />

# Why Manim [#why-manim]

As a math and computer science enthusiast with a passion for educational content, Manim aligns perfectly with this year's [goal
of creating content](/blog/2024-in-review#new-year-resolution) for my educational YouTube channel, [Pixel Projects](). While it was designed for
mathematical animations, Manim offers:

* A smaller learning curve compared to tools like Adobe After Effects for Python developers.
* Flexibility to create custom animations using Python.
* Open-source freedom to explore and contribute.

# Pre-requisites [#pre-requisites]

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. [brew](https://brew.sh/)
3. [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
4. [Rectangle]() (optional, for window management)

# Installation [#installation]

## Step 1 [#step-1]

Start by cloning the [manim-interactive](https://github.com/pprunty/manim-interactive) repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pprunty/manim-interactive.git
```

## Step 2 [#step-2]

The repository includes a `Makefile` that simplifies the setup process. To install the required dependencies and Manim itself, run:

```bash
make install
```

This will:

1. Install `ffmpeg` and `mactex` using `brew`.
2. Set up Manim in editable mode using Python's `pip`.
3. Install `setuptools` using `pip` (manimgl breaks if not installed).
3. Update the `custom_config.yml` with paths on your local machine.

## Step 3 [#step-3]

Once installed, confirm that the manimgl command is available by running:

```bash
manimgl --help
```

# Using the Makefile [#using-the-makefile]

The Makefile includes several commands to streamline your workflow and is a wrapper around the `manimgl` cli.
 To see a list of available commands, run:

```bash
make --help
```

Output:

```txt
Usage: make [target]

Targets:
  help            Display this help message
  install         Install dependencies and set up Manim in editable mode
  config          Configure custom settings for Manim
  upgrade         Upgrade the Manim library to the latest version
  interactive     Run an interactive animation

Interactive Target Usage:
  make interactive f=<file> [s=<scene>]
    f=<file>      Path to the Python file containing the animation (default: projects/examples/guide.py)
    s=<scene>     Optional: Name of the scene to render (default: None; allowing you to input which animation to play from the file)
```

# Running Animations [#running-animations]

Manim uses a `custom_config.yml` file to manage its configuration.
You can customize rendering options, such as resolution, output paths,
and other settings. The paths in your `custom_config.yml` were updated when you
ran `make install`. Here's a breakdown of the paths used:

```
.
├── Makefile
├── custom_config.yml #< Where your default manim configuration is stored
├── manim_imports_ext.py
├── media
│   ├── images #< Where you store images
│   └── vectors #< Where you store reference to svg images
├── projects
│   ├── 2025 #< Where you can store your new animation projects
│   └── guides #< Guide animations to reference when developing large scale projects
│       ├── 3d.py
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── custom_config.yml
│       ├── equation.py
│       ├── graph.py
│       ├── grouping.py
│       ├── image.py
│       └── text.py
├── stage_scenes.py
├── sublime_custom_commands #< Used for `make sublime` setup
└── videos # Where exported videos will be stored

```

## Running a Standard Animation [#running-standard-animations]

To render an animation, use the animations provided in `projects/guides/*.py`. They are
listed:

* `projects/guides/text.py`
* `projects/guides/image.py`
* `projects/guides/equation.py`
* `projects/guides/graph.py`
* `projects/guides/grouping.py`
* `projects/guides/3d.py`

These animations showcase isolated animations that can be used and referenced when creating complex
animations later.

To run an animation, you can use the command:

```bash
make run f=projects/guide/text.py s=TextScene
```

This will open an interactive window with the example animation.

You can interact with the animation using your mouse and keys:

* scroll the middle mouse button to move the screen up and down
* hold down the **z** on the keyboard while scrolling to zoom the screen
* hold down the **d** key on the keyboard and move the mouse to change the three-dimensional perspective.

Press **r** to reset scroll position, or **⌘** + **q** to close the window.

To choose dynamically which scene you would like to run from the `text.py` file, run:

```bash
make run f=projects/guide/text.py
```

And follow the output on your terminal for selecting which screen in the file to run.

To run animations from `image.py`:

```bash
make run f=projects/guide/image.py s=MovingImageScene
```

# Exporting Animations [#exporting-animations]

Export animations to a specified directory with high 4k resolution:

```bash
make export f=projects/guide/text.py s=TextScene
```

By default the mp4 file will be saved as `videos/projects/guide/text/TextScene.mp4`.

<Admonition type="info" title="Note">
By default exports are saved in 4K resolution. I do not see a reason why you would want to export
in lower quality, but if so you can remove the `--uhd` flag from the `Makefile` on the `make export`
command and update the resolution in the `custom_config.yml`.
</Admonition>

# Sublime Integration [#sublime-integration]

## Adding Terminus [#adding terminus]

Open your project using sublime text editor. Now hold cmd + shift + p to open command pallette, search
for install package and select that, then search "Terminus".

## Key Bindings [#key-bindings]

```json
[
   {
       "keys": ["ctrl+1"],
       "command": "terminus_open",
       "args": {
           "cmd": ["bash", "-i", "-l"],  // Start Bash as an interactive login shell
           "cwd": "${file_path:${folder}}",  // Set working directory
           "panel_name": "Terminus"
       }
   }
]

```

## Command Pallette [#command-paletee]

```json
[
   {
        "caption": "Terminal (panel)",
        "command": "terminus_open",
        "args": {
           "cmd": ["bash", "-i", "-l", "&&", "source ~/.bash_profile"],  // Start Bash as an interactive login shell
           "cwd": "${file_path:${folder}}",  // Set the current working directory
           "title": "Bash Terminal",        // Optional: Update the title
           "panel_name": "Terminus"
        }
   }
]
```

# Resolution Shortcuts [#resolution-shortcuts]

Nowadays, videos are made in vertical and horizontal resolution for long 4K (3840,2160) and short form (1080,1920) content. If you
want to make a short video, start by running:

```bash
make short
```

This will update the resolution in the `custom_config.yml` dynamically. You can then run a scene like before
using the `make run` command and using
this updated configuration see your animation in short-form resolution.

Likewise, to switch back to standard 4K video resolution, run:

```bash
make video
```

# Upgrading Manim [#upgrading-manim]

<Admonition type="warning" title="warning">
`manim-interactive` uses a static version of the `3b1b/manim` repository. If you are currently working on an existing project,
upgrading manim is not recommended as some changed made in the 3blue1brown maintained reposiotry could break your
current animation project.
</Admonition>

This project uses a static version of `3b1b/manim`, namely (#). If you wish to upgrade the verison of manim
running to a later version, maintained by Grant Sanderson and the 3blue1brown team, run:

```bash
make upgrade
```

This command:

1. Clones the latest version of the Manim repository.
2. Replaces the current library files with the updated ones.
3. Reinstalls the upgraded library.
