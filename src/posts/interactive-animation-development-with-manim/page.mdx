  This is a note
</Admonition>

***

Before getting started, here are a few pre-requisites you'll need:

1. [Sublime Text Editor](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
2. [brew](https://brew.sh/)
3. [GitHub account](https://github.com/)

# Installing Python [#installing-python]

The easiest way to manage your python environments is via `pyenv`:

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

Now add `pyenv` to your bash profile:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Once installed, install python version 3.12 and install it as your 
global python version:

```bash
pyenv install 3.12 && pyenv global 3.12
```

Validate the global version of python that you're running:

```bash
python --version
```

# Manim Installation [#manim-installation]

There are two known Manim libraries that you can use to create animations:

1. Manim Community (community managed manim library)
2. Manim GL (managed by 3b1b team)

Before installing manim, there are a couple of pre-requisites needed on your Mac:

```bash
brew install ffmpeg mactex
```

* `ffmpeg` - for video processing
* `mactex` - for LaTeX rendering

After installing the pre-requisites, you can download the manim library.

The community edition is the more stable and recommended package to download, however,
this edition does not prioritize the interactive editing environment that the 3b1b team does.
If your priority is to create a workflow wherein you can create and edit animation interactively,
which is where I believe the real value in this software lies, then start by forking the `3b1b/manim` repository on GitHub:

The Manim Community [tutorial and guides section](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/tutorials/quickstart.html), however, is extremely useful for getting started with creating complex
animations.

To do this, navigate to https://github.com/3b1b/manim and select "fork". Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/<your_manim_lib_name>.git
```

Now, navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the library:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This will install the library in "editable" mode, meaning you can make changes to the library and see them reflected
in your animations.

Additionally, you are required to install `setuptools` or else you'll run into issues running the `manimgl` command:

```bash
pip install setuptools
```

Now the `manimgl` command will be available globally on your machine and you're all set to start running animations.

# Running Interactive Animations [#running-interactive-animations]

## The Example Scene [#the-example-scene]

To run the example animation scene provided by manim, you can use the `manimgl` command. Run the following in
the root of the manim library you forked and cloned:

```bash
manimgl example_scenes.py OpeningManimExample
```

This will open an interactive window with the example animation.

You can interact with the animation using keys:

- **d**:
- **f**:
- **z**:

To quit, press **âŒ˜** + **q**.

# Interactive Animation Projects [#interactive-animation-projects]

Now, if you're planning on using manim *seriously* then we need to talk about how to manage projects and create
workflows within them.


# Note on Hacking the Manim library [#hacking-the-manim-library]

Since the Manim version forked is not a community managed edition of the library, there may be issues. You can 
try to fix these bugs, or add new features to your forked version by editing 
the content of the python files in the `manimlib` directory. To validate your changes
worked, you need to install your new version in a seperate venv and use this cli...

add instructions on how to install local manim version in venv, use the manimgl cli from that venv to test changes 
against your animation code.
