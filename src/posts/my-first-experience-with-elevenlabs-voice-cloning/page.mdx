Artificial Intelligence (A.I) based voice synthesis is getting good, *really good*.

You've probably encountered how good it is during one of your penitant doom-scrolling 
sessions (don't worry I do it too) where you watch a short video and hear a celebrity's voice saying something you know 
they would never say.

So why am I doing it? Do I want to illegally clone a celebrity's voice? Noooooo.

I have a desire to get into the content creation space and I have found some trouble writing 
scripts, only to have to re-write them again, and again, and *again* because they don't sound 
quite right in post-production.

That's where ElevenLabs comes in. Instead of having to setup my audio equipment and complete 
multiple takes of my script, I can use my voice clone to get a feel for how things will sound using my syntheticly generated voice.

# Instant Voice Cloning [#instant-voice-cloning]

The basic service offered by ElevenLabs is instant voice cloning. 

This service allows you to clone your voice using a
transcript and a recording of your voice. The service is available to use in the basic $1 subscription, but you must pay
for a professional voice clone (more on that later).

To get the best results, ElevenLabs recommends you use a production grade microphone and pop-filter <Ref id="1" />. I use a SHURE MV7, the second best SHURE microphone, with a
SHURE __ pop-filter (because some guy on YouTube said it sounds as good as the more expensive model with the 
more expensive model's pop-filter).

It is important to use a transcript that capture the nuances of your voice by enunciating the different sounds in the
language you speak. You can download the sentences I used [here]() <Ref id="2" />.

## Results [#instant-voice-cloning-results]

My authentic voice:

<MP3 src="/downloads/pprunty.mp3"/>

ElevenLabs voice clone:

<MP3 src="/downloads/elevenlabs.mp3"/>

Transcript used:

```txt
- "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

My authentic voice:

<MP3 src="/downloads/pprunty2.mp3"/>

ElevenLabs voice clone:

<MP3 src="/downloads/elevenlabs2.mp3"/>

```txt
- “In the bustling city, people hurriedly pass by, lost in their own worlds."
- "The serene sunset painted the sky with hues of orange, pink, and purple."
- "Sizzling bacon and freshly brewed coffee filled the kitchen with enticing aromas."
- "Gentle waves lapped against the shore, creating a soothing symphony of nature."
- "A mysterious figure emerged from the shadows, casting a long silhouette on the dimly lit alley."
- "In the heart of the forest, the rustling leaves whispered secrets of ancient times."
- "With a burst of laughter, friends gathered around a crackling bonfire under the starlit night sky."
```

Can you tell the difference?

I admittely have a neutral Irish (Dublin) accent which is replaced in the voice clone with 
an American accent which I rather not have (no offense but I'd simply rather keep my own).

The timing, however, is quite accurate. Meaning, I can use the A.I voice clone to read 
transcripts for YouTube videos, align the visual content with the audio in editing and in 
post-production record my own authentic voice. Thereby eliminating a lot of the baggage which 
comes with editing both visual and audio content.

# Professional Voice Cloning [#professional-voice-cloning]

Before you get your hopes up, ElevenLabs have introduced a voice authentication mechanism when getting your professional
voice clone. Meaning, it will give you some text to read and then ask you to read it again. This is to prevent people from
using the service to clone other people's voices. In any case, using another person's voice without their permission is illegal,
albeit not enforced. For instance, one *could* clone a celebrity's voice using ElevenLab's instant voice cloning service, and use
this voice clone to authenticate the professional voice cloning service.

## Results [#professional-voice-cloning-results]

The initial feedback I got from friends was crytpically that my voice does not sound as good as other educational 

```python
#include <iostream> // For std::cout
#include <format>   // For std::format (introduced in C++20, enhanced in C++23)

int main() {
    // Output a formatted "Hello, World!" message
    std::cout << std::format("Hello, {}!\n", "World");
    return 0;
}
```

My friend, Elliot Chambers, voice sounds remarkably like Grant Sanderson, better known as 3blue1brown on YouTube.

they'll stay for the butter.
