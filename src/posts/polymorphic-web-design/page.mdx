Every other day, I see somebody spam-advertising their Next.js template on Reddit/X/Hackernews, usually accompanied by a questionable screenshot of their first 100ish sales. [Marc Lou](), most notably
started this trend with his product [ShipFast]() and has had huge success. At least, *according to him*. 

If you know how to code and you're not looking for shortcuts, you'll know that everybody's code looks different and that every product 
use case is different. There's no one-size fits all. If you're going to use software to make more software, the software you're using 
needs to operate at an abstract/decoupled layer, like through `pip`, `npm`, or an open-source GitHub repository. Not behind a paywall.

Purchasing Marc Lou's template is probably good for one thing, and one thing only, to 
create another Next.js shitplate you can fob off as better than his. But that'll only work if you have a bigger social media following than 
him, _doubt_. It might sound harsh. But you're not going to build the next Facebook using one of these templates. 

I know these templates don't work because I tried to create one myself.

I worked on integrating all the secret sauce: `i8ln` for global translation, `next-auth` for authentication with providers 
such as Google and Apple, `tailwindcss` for styling, `stripe.js` for payment integration, and more. Then after like 2 hard iterations, I asked myself, _**what the 
fuck am I doing?**_ 

I'm building a supercharged shuffle that looks state-of-the-art but once it touches the gravel, all the pretty pieces 
start to fall off. 

I realised that building these templates is simply a way of procrastinating the developement of a meaningful 
product. _"Once the template is perfect, I'll be ready to go, you'll see"_ - I would tell myself. With the believe that if 
all else fails, well then I can just make the template the product. 

Should a failed codebase not good enough to create a 
meaningful product ever be ethically monetized and sold to others trying to do the same? My answer: a hard no. This not only goes against everything good 
that open source represents but is also irrational.

And so, I pivoted. 

In knowing I wasn't ready to create a meaningful product, I focused on the hardest part of any web application (in my opinion). Which 
is the layout, navigation and user experience.
