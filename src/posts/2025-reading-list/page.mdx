# Reviews [#reviews]

## *Small Things Like These* by Claire Keegan [#small-things-like-these]

Heartwarming novella, reminiscent of *Foster*. Keegan uses simple, yet sophisticated language combined with the Irish
vernacular to convey how doing of the smallest of things can make the biggest impact on the lives of others.

## *A Dance with Dragons* by George R.R Martin [#a-dance-with-dragons]

The fifth book in the *A Song of Ice and Fire* series. Martin continues to create an atmosphere of tension as things come
to a head in Westeros. Tyrion's chapters in particular are a highlight, as he navigates the political landscape of Essos
and experiences firsthand the experience of being a slave.

It is worth noting that Martin intended for there to be a five-year gap between *A Storm of Swords* and both
*A Feast for Crows* and *A Dance with Dragons*, however, disagreements with editors and the complexity of the story led to
the gap being abandoned.

There is, however, much to look forward to in the upcoming *The Winds of Winter*. Including the fate of Jon Snow, the
battle at Winterfell, and the mystery of the Pink Letter. That is, if George R.R Martin ever actually finishes the book...

In the meantime, I compiled all the preview chapters of *The Winds of Winter* into a PDF, eBook and Kindle formats. You
can download them [here](/blog/the-winds-of-winter-preview-chapters-free-ebook-kindle-and-pdf-download).
