Not everybody can program. But it is my believe that everybody should have the ability to have a piece of the internet
that they can call their own.

That is why I created Samwise, an open sourced digital blog template which is fully self-serviced, enabling you within the
space of 10 minutes to deploy a high-performance, SEO optimized and feature rich digital blog and portfolio website, hosted
at `https://<your_name>.vercel.app` totally for free that you can share with your friends, customize and create content on.

cornerstone on the internet, like I do: [https://patrickprunty.com](https://patrickprunty.com).

The best way to display a loading spinner from a user experience (UX) perspective is by not displaying it at all. This
is the mantra I repeated to myself whilst I developed the new version of my blog, [Samwise](), and abstracted it
as a [NextJS 15]() template for [open source use]().
