*This post is a quick reflection of my achievements, goals and lessons learned this year.*

# I'm Senior Now [#getting-old]

In September this year I was promoted as part of a transition to a new team to the role
of senior full-stack web developer. Meaning **more money**, **more responsibility**, and **more hours**.

Given the tech landscape, returning back to **web development** after some time in **AI/ML** might be considered a risk.
However, I'm working in a highly productive team contributing to applications which put
**product before innovation**.

For it's all well and good building the infrastructure around deploying and maintaining
AI/ML models but without an interface for the user to consume the results and
analytics these models produce in a positively re-enforcing experience, it's merely numbers on a screen (or an ugly Excel spreadsheet).

Diamonds don't shine when they're buried deep in the ground.
If you want the attention of leadership within your company, you need to put a bow and tie on the innovations you create. Web
and product development allows exactly for that.

# You're Just a Number [#just-a-number]

A number of my friends and colleagues were effected this year by the layoffs in tech.

Seasoned colleagues reassured me that this is simply part of our game. But for me, the survival syndrome 
did sink in and it was hard seeing friends out of work.

You're just a number. Work is important, you need to continuously perform and go beyond expectations to maintain a NET
positive value in the eye of the beholder (your employer), however, there is more to life.

At the end of the day, it's just a job.

# Good Morning Vietnam [#good-morning-vietnam]

This year my girlfriend and I visited the north (Hanoi, Sapa) and south (Hồ Chí Minh)
of Vietnam.

An 11-hour trip, ending in 30 degree celsius dampening heat, then a taxi ride resembling that of the night
bus from Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azakaban and I was re-thinking what we got ourselves into.

Driving in Vietnam is like skiing, you
watch out for the people in front of you and let them know you're coming by beeping the horn (you shout left or right skiing)
and you don't worry about the people behind you because they'll let you know that they're coming. There is structure to the chaos.

Cross the roads with your eyes closed or behind a crooked old man or lady.

I'm really not sure if the European way of driving is more or less evolved, there seems to be a method to the madness
in this style of driving in Vietnam.


hiking with sapa sisters was one of the highlights of my year.

This trip opened my eyes to the fact that regardless of culture, race or political ideologies.
Under the surface, all people are the same, more or less.

# Trying a Tri [#try-a-tri]

This year I completed my first [mini] triathlon, [RDJ's Try-a-Tri](https://www.dublincitytriathlon.com/).

It's petty in distance standards when compared to events in running and cycling that I've completed but having
nearly drowned as a child, and developed a fear of open water, it was a big deal to me.

Coming second place in this event has given me confidence to compete in a Sprint
or Olympic Distance Triathlon in 2025, and then later, an IRONMAN 70.3.

# Predicting The Future [#predicting-the-future]

![Scene From 2001: A Space Odyssey](/images/space-odyssey.webp)

Streaming will get bigger (Twitch). Personifying 'chat' during livestreams.

NVIDIA will continue to grow. If you needed any evidence, Lex Fridman's podcast with Dario __ should convince you, where
he consistently references the [scaling hypothesis]()

Now is a pretty good time to have dollars.

Migration statistics in Ireland will break another all-time high, in line with last year's statistics

old people will continue to get old and young people will continue to delay having children.

# New Year's Resolution [#new-years-resolution]

*Create, create, create.*

This can be done through blogging, YouTube content creation and montly targets for X/Instagram/LinkedIn posts.

Having grown up with the advent of social media in the early 2000s, I admitelly
loath the caraciature and unattainable ideals presented by people on social media. Therefore,
when I attended college, I decided to stop

But I realize the potential social media and content creation has to provide
[financial freedom](). And in order to evolve, you need to do hard things.
