*This post is a quick reflection of my achievements, goals and lessons learned this year.*

# I'm Senior Now [#getting-old]

Footballers enter their peak around this age, so it's all uphill from here (*uphill* because I've always found it

Senior means more responsibility

# You're Just a Number [#just-a-number]

You're just a number. Work is important, you need to continuously perform and go beyond expectations to maintain a NET
positive value in the eye of the beholder (your employer), however, there is more to life. At the end of the day, it's just a job.

# Good Morning Vietnam [#good-morning-vietnam]

hiking with sapa sisters was one of the highlights of my year.

Regardless of culture, race or political ideologies. Under the surface, all people are the same, more or less.

# Trying a Tri [#try-a-tri]

# Texas Hold 'em [#texas-hold-em]

# ¿Ahora, Hablo Español? [#espanol]

# blog.v2 has landed [#blog.v2]


It took some time but I finally released an open source digital blogging template built using NextJS 15 for public
use.
