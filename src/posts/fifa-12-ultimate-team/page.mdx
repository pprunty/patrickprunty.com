alt title: My (Questionable) Teenage Trading Strategies in FIFA 12

In Ireland, there's a phase in secondary education referred to as "transition year." Known colloquially as a "doss year".
This is the year when students move from junior to senior status within the school system, typically around the ages of 15 or 16. 
It's a time when academic pressures are lighter, allowing students to explore various subjects, engage in more sports, and 
participate in social activities like the school play. For me, I took this as an opportunity to binge-play 
FIFA 12. 

I played in more than 1,000 Ultimate Team matches. To give some context, each match takes about 8 minutes to complete. This translates to roughly 8,000 minutes, or 133 hours, which equals about 5.5 days of online play against other players. 
This total doesn't account for the time spent in lobbies waiting for matches, trading on the marketplace, or assembling my team, which could nearly double that playing duration.

So you get it, I played a lot of FIFA. And I was pretty good. Not just at match play but also on the marketplace. For those who do not know, 
the FIFA Ultimate Team marketplace allows you to buy and sell players on a free market by setting the starting price and optional buy now price for a 
player, which on screen is presented as a digital card. The price of these player cards are determined by their rarity, popularity and demand.

I never realized that the strategies I developed as a 15-year-old were applicable to actual market trading until a friend, who is a professional trader, suggested
I apply for a trading job after I shared my experiences with him.

I haven't mapped any of the strategies listed below to real-world practices. In the hope that a trader with real-world experience can [inform me](mailto:patrick.prunty@business.com) whether these actually
correspond to the real world or not.

# Fair Value Cards

There are tools that exist today which give the current average price for a card selling on the marketplace but back in the day, these didn't exist. I would eyeball it. Having 
a constant view of the market meant I had the advantage of knowing an intuitive fair price for a player given the market's current state on a intra-15 minute basis, versus some moving 
average over weeks or months. 

# Mispriced Cards

fat-finger mistakes

# Avoiding Commission Fees

# Bulk Buying Cards

Anyways, I applied for that trading position and even got through to the final rounds, but after being asked a series
of probability questions, what the distance from my location to their office in Philladelphia is to the nearest kilometer,
and what the speed of light is over the phone, I was told I was a great cultural fit but didn't make the cut. I guess they 
only hire computers.
