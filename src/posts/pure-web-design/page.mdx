*This is Part 2/3 in my series on developing a scalable SaaS product with Next.js for commercial use.*

Pure (Polymorphic) Web Design consists of implementing three distinct abstract layers:
**Structural**, **Latent** and **Widget** layers. The idea being if the structural layout 
(controlling layout, e.g header, footer and navigation links) and latent layers (containers e.g grid, 
stacked, vertical snap-scroll/tiktok scroll) can be optimized and configurable out-of-the-box, then 
developers need only worry about the developement of widgets (individual or composite components, e.g ...) 
which provide core-value offering for your productthrough interactig with an API via the click of a button, card or 
filling out of a form. 


This method breaks down application architecture into three distinct layers: **Layout**, **Container**, and **Widget**.
By abstracting these layers and centralizing configuration, developers can create polymorphic web interfaces suitable
for any SaaS product.

<Caption>The Abstract Layers of Web Design: Layout, Containers and Widgets</Caption>


# Configuration [#app-configuration]


# Layout Layer [#layout-layer]

The Layout Layer defines the website's structural skeleton and serves as the primary **navigation** control mechanism. It guides user movement through the application by:

- Establishing primary navigation paths (menus, links, headers)
- Providing clear user orientation signals (active colors, animations)
- Adapting navigation across different device types

Effective layout navigation ensures speed, provides clear feedback, and maintains consistent styling across the user's journey through the application.

**Desktop layouts**:

- SidebarMenu (does not include footer)
- HeaderAndFooter (includes footer)
- NarrowHeaderAndFooter (includes footer)
- SinglePageApplication

**Mobile Layouts**:

- BottomBar (optionally includes footer)
- StickyHeader (includes footer)
- HamburgerMenu (includes footer)
- HeaderAndFooter (includes footer, obviously)

## How I Solved the Navigation Problem

In Next.js, the `layout.tsx` file defines the layout for all pages that inherit that layout.

Suppose your webpage has four main pages: Home, Search, Profile and Settings. Wouldn't it be great to be able to determine
which layout best suits your needs?

By creating an
abstract layout, you can create something which will do the following:

```typescript
<Layout type={"HeaderAndFooter"} mobile={"BottomBar"}>
    {children}
</Layout>
```

It is important you track for the user, where in the application they are. This is done in different ways, depending on the 
type of layout.

# The Container Layer [#the-container-layer]

This layer determines how the content is arranged and displayed on the page. It focuses on organizing content into
grids, lists, carousels, or views like snap-scroll to shape the user experience and guide interactions.

The most common organizations are:

- Grid layouts
- Vertically stacked content (flexbox)
- Snap-scroll view (like TikTok)
- Masonry layout for images (like Pinterest)
- Controlled Grid Layout (using library like `react-grid-layout`)

# Modals [#modals]

Only use an entirely new webpage, if the content you plan to display on that webpage will not 
fit within a Modal/pop-up. Even if you consider the content to be too much, think of ways of how 
you can reduce the content such that it will fit in a Modal. If it still will not fit, only then 
use a new webpage and route.

# The Widget Layer [#the-widget-layer]

This layer deals with the individual components that users interact with. These are the building blocks of the interface,
including functional elements like buttons and cards, or media like photos and videos.

A widget can be a single component such as a button, or made up of multiple components, in which case it is referred
to as a **template** (if it's a reusable structure) or a **composite component** (if it combines multiple elements and
interactions).



## Widget Catalogue [#widget-catalogue]

*** 

If you made it this far, the great news for you is that I have made the initial 
version of this template open source on GitHub for your personal use. It is free to
use under MIT License and better than most of the drool Next.js paid templates you see
advertised on [r/sideproject]() and Twitter.
