There are three different layers to a web application:

1. Layout
2. Container
3. Widget

# Layout Layer [#layout-layer]

The layout layer controls the user experience from a navigation point of view. The layout layer typically displays a
header and footer, allowing users to navigate between pages in your web application. This should be as seamless as possible
and responsive for different screen sizes.

As a user you want:

1. **Speed**: The user does not expect to see a delay when navigating between webpages. The best way to show a loading spinner
is by not showing one at all.
2. **Feedback**: The user should, after selecting an item in the navigation to receive feedback via animation,
active color, or heading that they are on the page they selected.
3. **Consistent Styling**: The user does not wish to see webpages that are totally different with respect to styling after
navigation.


From my experience, the most popular layouts are:

**Desktop layouts**:

- SidebarMenu (does not include footer)
- HeaderAndFooter (includes footer)
- NarrowHeaderAndFooter (includes footer)
- SinglePageApplication

**Mobile Layouts**:

- BottomBar (optionally includes footer)
- StickyHeader (includes footer)
- HamburgerMenu (includes footer)
- HeaderAndFooter (includes footer, obviously)

## How I Solved the Navigation Problem

In Next.js, the `layout.tsx` file defines the layout for all pages that inherit that layout.

Suppose your webpage has four main pages: Home, Search, Profile and Settings. Wouldn't it be great to be able to determine
which layout best suits your needs?

By creating an
abstract layout, you can create something which will do the following:

```typescript
<Layout type={"HeaderAndFooter"} mobile={"BottomBar"}>
    {children}
</Layout>
```


It is important you track for the user, where in the application they are. This is done in different ways, depending on the 
type of layout.

# The Container Layer [#the-container-layer]

There are a few different types of containers:

- Stacked
- Snap Scroll View (like TikTok)
- Grid Layout (for images, cards, etc.)
- Controlled Grid Layout (customizable/resizeable grid)

# Modals [#modals]

Only use an entirely new webpage, if the content you plan to display on that webpage will not 
fit within a Modal/pop-up. Even if you consider the content to be too much, think of ways of how 
you can reduce the content such that it will fit in a Modal. If it still will not fit, only then 
use a new webpage and route.

# The Widget Layer [#the-widget-layer]

## Widget Catalogue [#widget-catalogue]

If you made it this far, the great news for you is that I have made the initial 
version of this template open source on GitHub for your personal use. It is free to
use under MIT License and better than most of the drool Next.js paid templates you see
advertised on [r/sideproject]() and Twitter.
