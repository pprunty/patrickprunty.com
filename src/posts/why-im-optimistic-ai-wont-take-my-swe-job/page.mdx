I told my family “with AI, I’ve gained in 1.5 years, skills that would have taken me 4 years without it”. 

AI becomes another abstraction. 

It’s becoming increasingly more important to be able to read and understand code than to write it. 

With this in mind, I believe that companies should hire more based on professional’s ability to understand complex systems versus solve a coding challenge.  

College courses should lecture students on reading code versus writing it. Instead of writing an assignment for a doubly linked list. They could be a given a standard implementation and asked “what are the edge cases”, “how can performance be enhanced?”, “how would this code need to change for a,b and c commercial use?” 

I would boast “I can do the same amount of work as 3 engineers using these technologies” - …

Product comes to engineering and engineering “calibrates” the agent / the problem of different forms of communication within companies 

OpenAI, I assume, are planning to market their agents “for hire” on some kind of marketplace. 

Companies giving data to the company who wins the AI race, becoming all powerful, etc.


```rust
fn opcode (bytes: &[u8]) -> (gba::Opcode, u16, u16) {
let rom = gba:: ROM: : from_bytes (bytes. to_vec()) ;
rom.opcode(0, laddress| bytes[address as usize])
}
#[test]
fn test_opcodes () {
assert_eq! (opcode(&[0x0]), (Opcode:: Noop, 1, 4)) ;
```
