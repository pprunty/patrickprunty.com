# What is Monte Carlo Methods?

example of estimating pi

# Random Number Generation

how random number generators are never really random , call out best ones

## Quasi-Random Number Generation

convergence is quicker using quasi random for estimating pi, use graph

# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

use real-world example of MCMC here..

metropolis algorithm

why this is useful with real-world example

plot with MCMC chain and its convergence here

the past 10 presidents have been republican, democrat, etc. , a naive approach would be to say
that if 70% of presidents have been republican, then there's a 70% chance that the next president will be
republican. however, this is not true. there are two possible outcomes, so you could say each outcome is
equally likely (50%), however there is some uncertainty.


financial graph simulation

# Usage in Large Language Models

Monte Carlo managing uncertainty

Sample -> Simulate -> Estimate Probabilities -> Define Confidence Intervals

agent based systems and emergent behaviors

Recommendation algorithms
