I'm a senior software engineer at UnitedHealth Group, from Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland. I owe much of my career to the incredible people around me and the Web.

To arrive where I am today, I took the road less traveled. I was never at the top of my class, the best athlete, or even the most social. But I come from a family that preach hard work pays off.

After high school, I spent a year working in construction with my Father. I then decided to pursue further education through a joint honors degree in English Literature and Mathematics. English because it was my natural strength, and Mathematics because I believed if mastered would open doors.

Fast-forward some years, and I now hold an MSc. in High-Performance Computing. It was here I learned the value of GPUs, low-level programming, and parallel computing before Bitcoin and ChatGPT, which leverage these technologies, took off. The dream of becoming a famous writer still smoldering in the sinews of my heart.

Today, I’ve carved out my niche as a full-stack software engineer, designing and developing web applications that deliver healthcare solutions and improve people's lives. It’s a role where my passions for storytelling, problem-solving, and innovation converge in meaningful and impactful ways.

Outside work, you will find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with loved ones. If you’d like to collaborate, discuss opportunities, or simply have a chat, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickprunty/) or via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com). My door is always open.
