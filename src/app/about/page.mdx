I'm a senior full-stack web developer at UnitedHealth Group, based in Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland.

I create content for two YouTube for two channels: [Jigsaw Presents]() — providing insight into trending
film and television series through video essays, and [__ Academy]() — presenting animated videos for topics
in computational mathematics, computer science and logic.

I also write on topics in software development, content creation and outdoor adventure in my [500ish blog](). Where
each post is written in 500ish words.

BA in Mathematics and English Literature, MSc. in High-Performance Computing.

Passions for web development, education, content creation and outdoor adventure.

Triathlon

I write and maintain a blog where each post is 500ish-words in length.

Passions include software development, content creation, outdoor adventure, and personal opinion.

To arrive where I am today, I took the road less traveled. I was never top of my class, the best athlete, or even the most social. But I come from a family that preach hard work pays off.

After high school, I spent a year working in construction with my father. I then decided to pursue further education through a joint honors degree in English Literature and Mathematics—English because it is my natural strength, and Mathematics for the doors it would open.

Fast-forward some years, I completed a MSc. in High-Performance Computing, gaining expertise in GPU technologies, low-level programming, and parallel computing before these became foundational to technologies like Bitcoin and ChatGPT.

Today, I work as a full-stack software engineer, developing healthcare solutions that improve people's lives. My role bridges technical expertise with business acumen—building modern web applications using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Python FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) while working closely with business teams to deliver highly competitive web products.

Outside work, you'll find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with loved ones. Feel free to reach out via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com). My door is always open. ☕️
