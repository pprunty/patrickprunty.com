I am a senior full-stack web developer at [Optum Healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optum) based in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm the creator of YouTube channels [Jigsaw Presents](), [Patrick Prunty](), and [*Educational Channel*](). I also also founder of [500ish.xyz](https://500ish.xyz), [*a shared newsletter/book club*](), and [thelastmanstanding.io](https://thelastmanstanding.io).

In addition to my technical projects, I've written some [short stories](), [poetry](), and [essays]() that you might enjoy. My [reading list]() for 20XX is available [here]().

When I’m not coding or pursuing creative endeavors, you’ll likely find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending quality time with loved ones.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickprunty), or reach out via
[E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com) for business inquiries.
