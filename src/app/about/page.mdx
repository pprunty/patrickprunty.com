I'm a senior software engineer at UnitedHealth Group, from Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland. I owe much of my career to the incredible people around me and the Web.

To arrive where I am today, I took the road less traveled. I was never top of my class, the best athlete, or even the most social. But I come from a family that preach hard work pays off.

After high school, I spent a year working in construction with my father. I then decided to pursue further education through a joint honors degree in English Literature and Mathematics—English because it is my natural strength, and Mathematics for the doors it would open.

Fast-forward some years, and I now hold a MSc. in High-Performance Computing. I learned the value of GPUs, low-level programming, and parallel computing before advancements such as Bitcoin and ChatGPT, which leverage these foundations, took shape.
And though I’ve embraced a career in technology, the dream of becoming an influential writer still smolders in the sinews of my heart.

Today, I work as a full-stack software engineer, developing healthcare solutions that improve people's lives. My role bridges technical expertise with business acumen—building modern web applications using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Python FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) while working closely with product teams to design and translate business requirements into elegant solutions.

Outside work, you'll find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with loved ones. If you'd like to collaborate or chat, reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrickprunty/) or via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com). My door is always open. ☕️
