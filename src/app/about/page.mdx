I&rsquo;m a senior software engineer at UnitedHealth Group. I&rsquo;m
from Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland. I owe much of my career to the Web
and the great people around me.

I spent my early teens consumed in creative passions â€” music, literature and
art. For this reason, I studied a joint honours degree in Mathematics & English Literature
and discovered a passion for programming through computational mathematics.

I later graduated with a MSc. in High-Performance Computing from Trinity College
Dublin. This gave me the opportunity to work as a software developer where I
discovered JavaScript and Web development.

Since then, I have used Web Development as a creative output.
