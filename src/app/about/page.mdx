I&rsquo;m a senior software engineer at UnitedHealth Group. I&rsquo;m
from Portmarnock, Dublin, Ireland. I owe much of my career to the Web
and the great people around me.

I spent my early teens consumed in creative passions â€” music, literature and
art. After studying a joint honours degree in Mathematics & English Literature,
I graduated with a MSc. in High-Performance Computing from Trinity College Dublin.

It was after this experience when I discovered a passion for Javascript and Web
development.
