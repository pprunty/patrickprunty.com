# Content I Like

I've often seen lists where individuals share the books they've read, and I find those quite insightful. The right book at the right time can profoundly change one's perspective. However, I haven't come across many lists focusing on other forms of content. Below is a compilation of such content. This isn't a "favorites" list; rather, these are pieces that, after experiencing them, I felt enriched.

The items highlighted are those that deeply affected me and are ones I frequently revisit.
