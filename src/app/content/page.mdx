# Content I Like

I've often seen lists where individuals share the books they've read, and I find those quite insightful. The right book at the right time can profoundly change one's perspective. However, I haven't come across many lists focusing on other forms of content. Below is a compilation of such content. This isn't a "favorites" list; rather, these are pieces that, after experiencing them, I felt enriched.

The items highlighted are those that deeply affected me and are ones I frequently revisit.

* **[Chimp Empire](https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/81311783)** (1 season / 192 mins): This documentary series, narrated by Mahershala Ali, shows how close chimps are to humans.
* **[The Alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel))**: Paulo Coelho's novel made me, a realist, believe in following omens and personal legends. I still don't check my starsign though.
* **[Squid Game](https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/81040344)** (1 season / 485 mins): This South Korean series is intense. It explores desperation and human nature in a way I've never seen before.
* <div className="text-red-500 font-semibold decoration">**[The Waste Land â€“ T.S. Eliot](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/47311/the-waste-land)**: A modernist poem that captures the disillusionment of the post-World War I generation, rich with symbolism and cultural references.</div>
* **[The Lord of the Rings Series](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls066489022/)** (3 films / ~680 mins): As a teenager, this trilogy sparked my imagination, making it live long into my teens.
* **[cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)**: When I was learning to program, this site was my bible. It's got everything you need to know about C++.
* **[Next.js/Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**: This framework made deploying web apps a breeze, especially compared to AWS and Azure, which offer nothing comparable to Vercel and their free tier.
* **[Paul Graham Essays](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html)**: Paul Graham's essays are super inspiring, especially for anyone interested in startups or tech. His simplistic approach to writing is very inspirational to me.
