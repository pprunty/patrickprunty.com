# content i like

i've seen a lot of lists where people list the books they read.

and, those are really helpful. the right book in the right moment can fully shift how you view the world.

but, never seen anyone do the same for content.

below is a list. this isn't a "favorites" list. they are all pieces of content where after i watched them, i was better.

the pieces of content in red are ones that deeply affected me, and pieces i return to.

* [chimp empire](https://www.netflix.com/ie/title/81311783) (1 season/192 mins)
* [the alchemist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemist_(novel))
