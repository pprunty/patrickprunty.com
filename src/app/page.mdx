I'm a senior full-stack web developer at [Optum Healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optum) based in Dublin, Ireland.

My journey in technology has been unconventional. I began my career in construction, spending a year as a plumber before deciding to pursue higher education.

I earned a B.A. in Mathematics and English Literature from [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), followed by an M.Sc. in Computational Mathematics and High-Performance Computing at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).

Today, I design and develop web applications that empower healthcare providers to deliver better care to thousands of
patients.

In addition to my professional work, I dedicate my spare time to creative endeavors, including my [YouTube channels](/#youtube-channels), [personal blog](/) and [open-source projects](/#software-projects).

When Iâ€™m not coding or working on creative projects, you can find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with my loved ones.

Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickprunty), or reach out via
[E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com) for business inquiries.
