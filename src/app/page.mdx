I'm a senior full-stack web developer at [Optum Healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optum) based in Dublin, Ireland.

I run a YouTube channel called [Pixel Projects](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OToaksgWe-pjkgqPkUZkw?sub_confirmation=1),
share my perspectives on life in my [personal blog](/blog), and contribute to open-source projects.

When I'm not programming or engaging in creative endeavors, I enjoy training for triathlons, hiking, and spending quality time with my family and friends.

# About [#more-about-me]

My journey in technology has been unconventional. I began my career in construction‚Äîspending a year as an apprentice plumber‚Äîbefore discovering my passion for programming.

After earning a B.A. in Mathematics and English Literature from [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/), I pursued an M.Sc. in Computational Mathematics and High-Performance Computing at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/).

Today, I channel my diverse background into designing and developing web applications that empower healthcare providers to deliver better care to tens of thousands of patients.

I thrive on creative challenges‚Äîwhether that's writing code, crafting content, or filmmaking‚Äîand find inspiration in the great outdoors through travel, hiking and triathlon.
