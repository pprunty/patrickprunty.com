I'm a senior web developer based in Dublin, Ireland.

Creator of [Pixel Projects](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OToaksgWe-pjkgqPkUZkw), an educational YouTube channel exploring computational mathematics and computer science through storytelling and animations (videos coming soon).

When I'm not programming or working on creative projects, you can find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with my loved ones.

Connect with me on [X](https://x.com/pprunty_), or reach out via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com) for business inquiries. My professional CV is available [here](/CV.pdf).

## Blog [#blog]

I keep a [personal blog](/blog) where I share insights into my experiences and opinions on life, technology, and personal projects.

Each blog post is written in 500ish wordsâ€”just enough to deliver valuable ideas without overwhelming your schedule. Read
the latest posts [here](/blog).
