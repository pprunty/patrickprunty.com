I'm a senior web developer currently based in Dublin, Ireland.

I'm also the creator of the YouTube channel, [Pixel Projects](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5OToaksgWe-pjkgqPkUZkw), where I explore topics in computational mathematics, computer science, and much more through a combination of storytelling and visual animations.

{/*
I'm also founder of [thelastmanstanding.io]()...
*/}

Additionally, I share my thoughts on life, technology, and open-source projects on my [personal blog](/blog).

When I'm not programming or working on creative projects, you can find me training for triathlons, hiking, or spending time with my loved ones.

Connect with me on [X](https://x.com/pprunty_), or reach out via [E-mail](mailto:patrickprunty.business@gmail.com) for business inquiries.

My digital CV is available [here](https://read.cv/pprunty).
